Facebook Slideshow


This is just a startup base for people who wants to add Facebook photos as a website background slideshow.

There are lots of data you can push from Facebook using it's FQL (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/technical-guides/fql/)

By the way, this is my first ever published work here in git so any help would be very appreciated.


Hope this be useful to you.
